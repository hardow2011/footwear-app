  content_en: "<p dir=\"ltr\">Flat feet or low arches can cause more than just discomfort–they can result in complications such as overpronation, bad posture, bunions and even lower back pains [1].</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Preserving a proper arch level is essential to maintaining a proper standing, walking and running form, as well as to properly balance the body weight at the center of each foot; failure to do so leads to the development of weak feet, and subsequently, potential injuries [2].</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"causes-of-flat-feet\">Causes of Flat Feet</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Flat feet or low arches can develop due to both genetic and environmental factors. <br>While some people are born with this condition, others develop it over time due to poor posture, improper footwear usage or prolonged standing. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In some cases, carrying heavy loads or wearing shoes that curl the toes can also contribute to a gradual weakening of the arch [2]. Over time, these stressors can lead to overpronation, where the foot rolls inward excessively, straining the arch and causing pain or discomfort [3]. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Left unaddressed, flat feet can affect your entire body alignment and lead to other complications such as bunions or lower back pain.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"footwear-solutions-for-flat-feet\">Footwear Solutions for Flat Feet</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A simple, yet effective method of alleviating the effects of having a low arch is acquiring footwear with the proper support.<br>Depending on the amount of support and stability provided, shoes can be categorized in three tiers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Motion control shoes</p></li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Stability shoes</p></li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Neutral shoes</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"motion-control-shoes\">Motion Control Shoes</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Motion control shoes work best for athletes with severe overpronation, or a noticeably low arch. They provide support by limiting the excessive inward rolling of flat feet with the objective of more closely emulating the normal pronation of a neutral arch.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"stability-shoes\">Stability Shoes</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While motion control shoes are ideal for those with severe overpronation, stability shoes, in turn, offer adequate support for individuals suffering from mild to moderate overpronation.<br>Individuals with a mild to moderately low arch may benefit the most from wearing stability shoes as they offer a good balance between support and flexibility; a middle ground between neutral and motion control shoes.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"neutral-shoes\">Neutral Shoes</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Neutral shoes are better suited for individuals with a neutral arch, given that they provide no unnecessary arch support nor reduced rearfoot movement.<br>Neutral shoes are also well-equipped for people with high arches, but they should ideally have a good amount of cushion. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The high cushion allows the midsole to compensate for the lack of flexibility of a high, rigid and inflexible arch by providing more shock absorption against the ground [4].</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The lack of support offered by neutral shoes can be a problem for people with a low arch because they will have no protection against overpronation.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"methods-of-providing-stability\">Methods of Providing Stability</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stability and motion control shoes employ various methods to offer the right amount of support.<br>Their midsole tends to be firmer than their neutral counterpart, particularly the inner side; they may feature a supportive heel counter to prevent the heel from sliding in the shoe; a wider base can also be featured, to provide lateral stability and aid in limiting excess movement.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"shoes-recommendations\">Shoes Recommendations</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are a few recommendations for some of the best shoes for flat feet or low arches.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Best stability shoes: </p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Brooks Adrenaline GTS: Known for its GuideRails® support system, which helps stabilize the ankles and knees [5].</p></li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Hoka Arahi: Provides lightweight stability with a firm midsole.</p></li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Hoka Gaviota: Offers extra cushioning for flat feet, with stability features.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Best motion control shoes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Brooks Beast GTS: Known for its strong support and cushioning for severe overpronation.</p></li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Brooks Ariel GTS (Women’s): A women’s exclusive model, similar to the Brooks Beast GTS, also provides maximum stability and support.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Sources:</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">[1] D.
